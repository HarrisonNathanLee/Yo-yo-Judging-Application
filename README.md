The Yo-yo Judging Application
Created by: Harrison Lee


I have created an application which goes through the steps of judging a player in a contest. The user/judge begins by inputting general player and routine information. They are then prompted to score the player technically using keystrokes in place of clickers. Finally, the judge inputs performance evaluation scores dependent on the type of the routine. After proceeding through these steps, the application will analyze the data and output this to the player. This information can then be used to help determine areas of improvement.

Watch the video below for a brief demo of the application: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8wVsHlPBMw&feature=youtu.be
